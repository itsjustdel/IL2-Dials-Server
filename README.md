# IL2-Dials-Server
Reverse engineers the flight sim IL-2 Sturmovik and creates a server to send data over UDP. 

The aim of this project was to make flight telemetry available to power dashboard apps or home cockpits. Whereas most flight sims or racing sims provide this information to end users, IL-2 Sturmovik does not. I thought it would be a fun project to try and learn how to reverse engineer software and see how far I could get with extracting the data.

This is an ongoing project and also includes an [Android and Windows client](https://github.com/itsjustdel/IL2-Dials-Client) to present the data. I have received consent from the executive producer of the publisher, 1C Company, and there is also an ever expanding team of voluntary testers who enjoy reporting back any suggestions or bugs they find. [You can track the testing process here.](https://discord.gg/tuN8yuwS9V)
